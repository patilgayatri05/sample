//in one file ypu only have single export default statement

//if you wanna export more then ypu can export it by using export keyword behind function

//eg export greet() or export meet()
//if you want import that then then used {} to function
//eg. import {greet,meet} from 'utils/dummy'

/*if export default : no need of curly braces
if only export then {} must

and if you wanna change function name then used "as" 
eg. greet as goa
